# World War III

## Introduction

I have created this game for fun in my leisure time.

In this game, I have created a Console-based battle game.

| Players           | Features | Choices | Extra Feature               |
|:---               | :---     | :---    |:--                          |
| User              | Armor    | Attack  |Bomb(Only available to User) |
| Enemy (Computer)  | Weapon   | Heal    |                             |
|                   |          |         |  

Note: Armor and Weapon is pre-defined for Enemy. 

It has a basic design to easily follow the code .

Code is well-indented, formatted and comments are added where required.
