# Restaurant Management

## Introduction

- In this Assignment, I have created a Console-based Restaurant management system.
- There are 3 interfaces.

| CUSTOMER                                                                 | ADMIN                      | Exit                  |
|:---                                                                      | :---                       |:---                   |
| Welcome message for customers                                            | Enter a Password to log in | To terminate the loop |
| Display main menu items                                                  | Get a Main Menu Interface  |                       |
| Customers will choose a main menu item (Eg: Soup)                        | Can perform various tasks  |                       |
| Out of given options (Eg: Chicken Noodle Soup), customer will choose one | Exit                       |                       |
| After choosing, customer will direct to menu item                        |                            |                       |
| Customers will choose another menu item                                  |                            |                       |
| At the end of order, customer will get subtotal                          |                            |                       |

- It has a basic design to easily follow the code .
- Code is well-indented, formatted and comments are added where required.
